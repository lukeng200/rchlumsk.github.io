A repository for storing and updating [my personal webpage](https://rchlumsk.github.io).


## Creating a Github pages webpage

To make your own webpage using Github pages with this template:
\* create a new repository on your github account with the name *username*.github.io (as per the [Github pages website](https://pages.github.com/));  
\* download the files from my repository (rchlumsk.github.io) or any other Github pages website that is public, accessible based on the license type;  
\* modify the downloaded files with your own information using a text editor or other editor;  
\* commit and push the files to your *username*.github.io repository; and  
\* go to your *username*.github.io webpage to view your website (this may take a few minutes to update once changes are made in the repository).
